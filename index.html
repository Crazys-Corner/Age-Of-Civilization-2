            <h3>What is AoC you might ask?</h3>
            <span>Hello, and welcome to the amazing and ever-changing world that is known as Age of Civilization! With over 100 mods we simulate the political struggles and mind-numbing stress of leading a country ^_^
            </span>   <br> <br>    
            <span>Kidding, mostly :P. This honestly isn't that stressful but it has its moments lol. On this World Map, you can either lead an unclaimed country or join an existing established nation. You then gather resources and bit by bit complete the quest chain that will help guide you through the many mods at your disposal. And there is a class system; you can pick one of three classes (miner, blacksmith, and chef) which forces players to work as a team or nations to trade. You can solo, but like it or not you will have to talk and make some friends in this wacky world if you want to go far and make a name for yourself üòÑ
            </span> <br> <br> 
            <span>Make friends, befriend your enemies; Build a nation, destroy another; Show how likeable you are, and then backstab (or try to) those who trust you the most for your own personal gain. The possibilities here are endless my friends, and I hope you join us and experience the plethora of ways of having fun ‚ù§Ô∏è
            </span> <br> <br>
            <span>Ooh, almost forgot! We have a website as well, where you will find the discord link and dynmap where you can see how the world has developed. The modpack went through a small "big" update and has been updated to 2.1.0. Some new mods addeth, a few old mods takenth. That, and the world map has been scaled from 1:4000 to 1:1000. It may not sound like much to anyone who doesn't know what that looks like, but it is way bigger than you might think (<-- That's what she said :P). So, there is plenty for you to get into with some parties still having to get their nations started. Join quickly if you want at the chance to be great!
