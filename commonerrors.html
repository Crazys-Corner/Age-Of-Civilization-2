        <h1>Common Errors and their Fixes</h1><br><hr><br><br>


        <h3>Troubleshooting Server to Client connection issues</h3>
        <br>
        <span>If you are having an issue connecting to the server, attempt to restart your pc, router, and modem. If that does not work, open a ticket in the discord. You can open tickets from the #help channel. 
        </span><br><br>
        <h3>Missing Mods or Mod Conflicts</h3><br>
        <span>If you are getting errors printed in red text when joining the server talking about missing or conflicting mods, your modpack is not up to date. To update your modpack, see the following tutorial: </span><br>
        <a href="https://support.curseforge.com/en/support/solutions/articles/9000206622-how-to-update-change-a-modpack-s-version">Tutorial (External Website)</a><br><br>
        <h3>Eating Food is Slow</h3>
        <br>
        <span> This is a feature of the “Spice of Life” mod. See its mod page for more details:
        </span><br>
        <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/the-spice-of-life">Modpage (External Website)</a> <br> 
        <h3>Game disconnected or crashed whilst flying</h3>
        <span>This is an unfortunate issue regarding the max packet size servers can send to players. You were rendering so many chunks that the server could not send you the data fast enough. If this happens open a ticket in the discord #help channel immediately and please do not join until given the go ahead by a staff member. </span><br><br>
        <h3>Server Closed whilst flying</h3>
        <span>This is an unfortunate issue caused by loading lots of chunks with vehicles from the Immersive Vehicles mod. We are still looking into the exact cause of the issue, but for now please see the Game Crashed/Disconnected When Flying article for help. </span> <br><br>
        <h3>JEI not showing Recipies</h3>
        <span>This is not a glitch or bug, you have yet to research the item in the tech tree. See more info about the tech tree <a href="https://help.ftb.team/help/en-gb/5-ftb-quests/25-player-guide">here (External Website.)</a> </span><br>
        <span>Important Note: Do not join an FTB quests team under any circumstance, you must create your own. 
        </span><br><br>
        <h3>Cannot see any ores</h3>
        <span>This is an intentional feature. If you do not have the Miner role you will not be able to see ores. If you are a miner and you can't see ores, please make a ticket.</span><br>
        <span>Please see <a href="skillsystem.html">Skill System</a> for more details.</span>
