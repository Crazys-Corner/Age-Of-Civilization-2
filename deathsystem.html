<h1>Death System</h1>
<p>It's probable that you will die sometime in the server, but don't worry, it's not the last we'll see of you.</p><br>
<h3>Death</h3>
<p>When you die, you will be instantly kicked from the server and banned. Now, this ban only lasts for 48 hours (2 days)</p>
<br>
<h3>Revival</h3>
<p>If you don't want to wait the 48 hours, then you can get a friend to get an enchanted golden apple through the quest tree. If you already have an enchanted golden apple, you can ask someone to get it either from your dead body or your base to revive you. To get revived, ask a mod and show them the evidence of the enchanted golden apple. We will unban you and destroy the apple.</p>
<br> <h3>Glitches></h3>
<p>If you were to die to a glitch, get in contact with a mod. It's best to have a recording system on at all times to help your process in being unbanned. If you have one, send a video or voice recording of the time of death. We do this so we can be confident that you are not lying to us about the glitch. If it is a major glitch, please report it by making a ticket in the help channel.</p>
<br><h3>Bodies</h3>
<p>Do not worry. You may be fearful that your unprotected corpse can be looted, but it cannot. Rules state that corpses can only be looted if killed in a raid. No combat or accidental deaths leave your body for the taking, and are protected until you can retrieve your items.</p>
